## Getting started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `yarn`

## Notes

All tests use an example Postgres dataset called [Pagila](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila).

If you want to debug a generated query or explore the test dataset, you can use `yarn psql` to get a Postgres console to an ephemeral database.
